## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ (or Miniconda/Anaconda)
- OpenRouter API key (for Qwen model access)
- Google Custom Search API key and Search Engine ID
- Git and GitHub account

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/clinical-research-daily-brief.git
cd clinical-research-daily-brief
```

2. Create conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate clinical-research-brief
```

Alternatively, if you prefer pip:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set environment variables:
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
export GOOGLE_CX="your-custom-search-engine-id"
```

4. Run the pipeline locally:
```bash
python pipeline.py
```

5. View the generated site:
```bash
open site/index.html
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can control the pipeline behavior with environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
# Qwen API Configuration via OpenRouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key-here

# Google Search API Configuration (Optional but recommended)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
GOOGLE_CX=your-custom-search-engine-id

# Pipeline Configuration
DAYS_BACK=60               # Search window in days (current: 60)
DEFAULT_MAX_ENTRIES=5      # Max articles per search query (current: 5)
```

**Enhanced Performance**: The pipeline is optimized for maximum coverage and quality:
- Uses **20 LLM-generated search queries** + PubMed API + arXiv + RSS feeds for comprehensive discovery
- Searches last **60 days** for extended coverage of breakthrough research
- **Multi-tier quality filtering** eliminates generic homepage titles and category pages
- **Enhanced URL validation** ensures only article-specific content is processed
- **Advanced title quality checks** prevent navigation/branding content from appearing in results
- **Premium UI** with real-time search, filtering, and glassmorphism design
- Estimated daily cost: ~$0.10-0.20 (Qwen model is more cost-effective than GPT-4o-mini)
